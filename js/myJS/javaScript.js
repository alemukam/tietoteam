A system was created for the pilot project for collecting, analysing and visualizing video material.<br>The City of Helsinki wants to improve its capability of obtaining a real-time view of traffic from multiple data sources. A real-time view of traffic is a graphic view of data related to traffic, lanes, the locations of means of transport, and conditions. It can provide a short-term forecast of traffic volumes, the smoothness of traffic, incidents, punctuality and prevailing conditions.<br>Situation data based on a real-time view plays a central role in improving the smoothness and predictability of daily journeys and transportation as well as traffic safety. Data can be transmitted to end users, service providers and others who can benefit from it. Traffic data collected over a longer period can be analysed so as to draw up forecasts of traffic flows and the effects of various incidents compared with the normal situation. Examples of incidents are traffic jams caused by major public events and accidents as well as poor weather conditions. Forecasts help in guiding traffic effectively immediately after an incident and preparing for the consequences. Real-time analysis of traffic data also enables better services for city residents. Data on vacant parking spaces can be distributed to motorists involved in the system. Video material also reveals when it is time to clear snow from bicycle and pedestrian paths. The Finnish Transport Agency collects travel time data, requiring a lag of no more than one minute from the actual situation.<br>It is expected that the investment costs needed to improve the quality of the real-time view can be recovered through reduced costs of accidents, congestion and emissions, as well as through new business operations. The real-time view makes it possible to address incidents due to their rapid identification, positioning and forecasting.</p>"

This time, the IT solution had to be more flexible to the company’s intentions to grow by 15 percent each year, and expand from 5 000 to 10 000 employees within the next three years. ÅF needed a common IT solution with high availability to the company’s global offices and at the same time be adaptable to the expansion of their business. The solution also needed to be adapted to improve efficiency for the employees with a unified global solution.<br>New infrastructure and flexible cost control model, “Price-Per-Employee”.

The new global IT platform was based on standardized service and also scalable in order to be adaptable to different countries’ needs.

Tieto’s development of “Price-Per-Employee” made it easier for ÅF to predict and control IT costs when acquiring new companies. The platform is based on a fixed price, “Employee All” which means that the fee is based on the company’s number of employees. More specific services can also be added to the service, country-by-country. For example: ÅF in Sweden got the most comprehensive service catalogue and add-on services per user in Sweden</p>"

html: "<h3>New digital services promoting wellbeing at work</h3><p>Every company is currently thinking about digitalization – what it is and how best to implement it in their field of business. The fast-paced modern world demands new kinds of innovation from companies. There is a constant need to develop digital services that take into account the special needs of customers. The pension insurance company Elo began to develop digital service models and approaches for well-being at work with the Tieto Experience Hub innovation programme (XHub). XHub is based on fast innovation, the testing of ideas and validation by end-users. “XHub is an interesting programme. It combines two things: solving practical issues and finding a new way of development. At the same time, it allows us to see how we can be agile as an organisation,” Tikkanen describes.<br>“XHub supports innovation through networks and open interaction with Elo customers. This makes the development more efficient and ensures that the new services meet the needs of the users. Furthermore, we encourage Elo to step outside their comfort zone and recognise new business models from outside their sector as well,” says Business Consultant Fanny Vakkila from Tieto. The XHub programme stages can include, for example, innovation workshops with new partners, design projects, service design and the discovery of prototypes through hackathons. “Everything is based on trials and receiving immediate feedback. If something doesn’t work, we don’t hesitate to change direction. This lets us now early on whether the idea is good and whether there is an actual need for the service,” Tikkanen describes. Tieto experts have directed the development and the new working method. Furthermore, Tieto has compiled a network of different operators to innovate together with Elo. “Tieto has managed to find good people with vision both from technology and digital services. Our operation has become faster, as the partners understand our field,” Tikkanen states.<br>The development of digital solutions was initially concentrated on well-being at work, and then, as the XHub programme progressed, the focus shifted to Elo’s business customers. In terms of the number of insurance policies, Elo is the largest pension insurer of entrepreneurs in Finland, so this new solution will serve a great number of customers. Digital services help entrepreneurs as they can be used in the evenings or at weekends, when Elo cannot offer personal customer service. “We have received positive feedback on our personal service, so it is important to figure out how to get our digital services to the same level,” Tikkanen points out. According to Tikkanen, the participation of end-users, i.e. entrepreneurs, in every stage of the development has been important. Furthermore, XHub has combined different sectors of business within Elo. “Within the company, XHub has been a valuable project. It passes through the entire organisation and combines well-being experts, IT and business development. Everyone has been excited about the new approach and learned a lot,” Tikkanen explains. “It has been a treat to follow Elo’s journey in the XHub programme. Their courage and enthusiasm to try out new working methods has been an inspiration to the entire XHub team,” Vakkila says happily.<br>Owned by its customers, Elo is a pension insurance company that takes care of the statutory pension insurances of its customer company employees and entrepreneurs. Elo is the largest pension insurance company in Finland: a third of all Finnish companies and over 40% of entrepreneurs have chosen Elo to manage their pension insurances. Elo is responsible for the future pensions of around 500,000 employees and entrepreneurs, and takes care of 210,000 pensioners and around €20 billion worth of investments.</p>"
